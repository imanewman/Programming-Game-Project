How to trigger event:


The event is triggered by clicking on the screen.



What should happen:


After clicking on the screen, a group of Sinkhole entities is created of a random size between 1 and 3,
 indicating how many rings from the center there are. 
The screen also rumbles back and forth,
 the extent of which depending on the Sinkhole size.
The Sinkhole acts as an intraversable obstacle to moving entities.

There is a 50% chance that one block on the outermost ring will be saved, with a 25% chance of recursing the random saving.

There is also an 8% chance that any sinkhole on the outermost ring will be replaced by an alien.

These aliens chase after MinerNotFull entities and turn them into randomCreature entities,
 which are only converted back to miners when they collect 2 ore. 
When the aliens die, 
they have a 50% chance to create another sinkhole.
After 30 moves, if the randomCreatures havent gotten enough ore, 
they turn into Lawnmower entities, which clean up the sinkholes.



Further description of entities:


Sinkhole - the group of sinkhole entites has a source, located at the mouse click, 
from which the other sinkholes eminate in rings. The source handles creating the other sinkholes around it, 
and shaking the screen. the other sinkholes simply occupy space and dont perform actions.



Alien - the alien entity first rises out of the gound (though almost too quickly to see), 
before beginging to chase after miners and convert them into randomCreatures. 
These aliens are set to have a max lifespan of 30 moves before disappearing.



RandomCreature - the randomCreature entity randomly selects between either a raccoon, snake, or rat. 

These entities behave similarly to minerNotFulls, but move faster. As such,
 they are also returned to being
 a miner after colecting 2 ore. 



Lawnmower - these entities move slowly after sinkholes and slowly remove the sinkhole objects until they turn 
back into miners after 30 moves.
